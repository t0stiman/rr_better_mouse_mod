# Better Controls Mod

This mod for Railroader changes some game controls. All of these tweaks can be toggled from the mod settings menu (ctrl-F10). Not all tweaks are enabled by default.

Camera:
- Toggle 3rd person camera movement with right click instead of holding.
- Camera rotation smoothing is disabled, making the controls much more precise.
- Panning the 3rd person camera with the left mouse button is disabled. This prevents accidental panning when miss-clicking.

Pause menu:
- Change the key to pause the game

Vehicle controls:
- Change the amount of throttle notches on steam locomotives.
- Change how fast vehicle control inputs should be repeated when holding the button.

Locomotive switching:  
- When you select a locomotive, place your avatar in an unoccupied seat in the locomotive.

Other tweaks:  
- Console patch. There is a bug in Railroader where the console would close when you try to type something. Enable this to get rid of that bug.
- Flip switches from further away when you zoom in with your camera.
